  <p>I make videos that combine my own performances with lo-fi digital animation.  Through repetitive, matched, and often simplistic color choices and recurring symbols, the works demonstrate both an internal logic and a personal need for order.   Whether by exposing this need or by presenting the systems I use to solidify my sense of self, I perform a relation to the viewer that is both close and distant.</p>

    <p>Far from creating seamless illusion, my videos acknowledge rather than conceal my digital intervention in the footage.  Editing for me is also a process of editing my self— not just as an image but as a construct.  With a degree of transparency into this editing process and into he logic that governs it,  I display the differences that separate myself and the viewer as only I experience them. </p>

    <p>By confronting the way I internally symbolize the reality of other people, I neither affirm nor bridge a chasm between myself and the viewer as they exist in their own interiority.  Instead I acknowledge the cracks in any framework that might otherwise purport to permanently ground us together. </p> 

    <p>My musical compostions are also experiments of ordering through digital software.  I use a highly systematized and mathematical composition process, taking recordings of drum phrases and editing them into evolving patterns accompanied by layers of synthesizers.  My illustration work is highly systematic as well– I develop iconographic symbols that relate in different ways throughout a series of drawings.  Here, I play with the simplicity of line drawings while diagramming abstract philosophical concepts</p>
