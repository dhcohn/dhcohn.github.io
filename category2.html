Cast of Elements:

          <div class="column">
            <h3>
Male Subject: This is the human element of the video and he is the subject in two senses: the subject in a procedure or experiment and the subjectivity with which the viewer identifies.  He is to be thickly bearded so that he resembles a pious religious man.
            </h3>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>
Death-Mother:  She is the divine element of the video, an embodiment of God but also an inverted projection of the male ego of the subject. As will be made clear, there is a certain androgyny to this character that represents both her doubled relation of sameness and difference to the subject as well as the impossibility of the subject&#39s God.
            </h3>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>
The Doll: This is the neuter element of the video and is related to the subject in an obverse way as the Death-Mother (the both-ness of the Death-Mother’s androgyny frames the subject on one side by eternity while the neither-ness of the Doll&#39s neuter frames the subject on the other side by a timelessness closer to the nothingness of not existing at all).  This element makes a brief appearance in order to parallel the transformation of the subject and to model his death after a peculiar existential castration.

The Concept:
            </h3>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>
Applying a Lacanian perspective on sexual difference and a deconstructionist understanding of text to notions of eternity and death, this video aims to psychologize monotheism and articulate a particular gnostic vision as a result.  The Death-Mother is that metaphysical entity behind the scenes of the life of the subject—that set of eyes that always watches us watching, that would take our experience of the present as it is lived and give it a simultaneous objectivity of the past—but rendered and embodied in what might be called the death-space of the video.  The impossibility of such a rendering (equally the impossibility of envisioning God) is represented by her doubled sexuality, which also serves as an analogy for the doubled-over temporality of life lived and life apprehended.  The doll is in a sense the opposite of the death-mother: the subject stripped of his will, the impossibility of death on the obverse side of the impossibility of eternity.  The text (made from moving cut-out letters, almost like a ransom note) that will accompany the video will serve the function of subtitles (there is no audible speech) but will also serve to underscore the impossibility that any act of speech or writing could relate the subject to his God or equally relate the video to a concept that can only ultimately escape it.  The video’s juxtaposition of stop-motion and real&#45time will also conceptually parallel the juxtaposition of timelessness and activity trying to be conveyed.  That is, the timelessness of the actively lived present&#45&#45the way in which the present moment disintegrates if it lacks reference to linear time, to origin and ending—is paralleled by the disconnectedness of choppy stop&#45motion video.

            <h3>
The video is structured along with the eleven eight-bar sections of the audio track.  The video will be shot almost entirely in a blank white space with plenty of lighting, though the aesthetic will be a gritty visual quality with slightly flat light to match the grittiness of the audio. 
            </h3>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>  
1)  The Death-Mother is introduced.  From darkness the whiteness of the space emerges and along with it appears a figure centered in the shot.  The figure is dressed in an all white fencing outfit or perhaps just a tightly fitting white costume that entirely conceals the woman inside.  Piece by piece of the costume is removed and almost instantaneously the corresponding revealed flesh turns black.  That is, a piece of clothing is removed and then the skin just revealed is painted black, then another piece of clothing is removed and then that section of skin turns black, one at a time, the face last.   This section ends with a crescendo that coincides with the Death-Mother, now entirely black and seemingly naked, opening her eyes violently.
            </h3>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>
2)  The Subject is introduced.  He appears instantly seated in a chair and grasping the hand of the Death-Mother, who gazes down at him the second he appears as if she conjured him there.  Also appearing with the subject is a stand-up full-body mirror that stands in front of him.
            </h3>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>
3)  The Death-Mother smears black lipstick onto the subject&#39s lips and he annunciates silently and with the corresponding caption, my God.  The subject appears bewildered, almost as if in a trance.
            </h3>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>
4)  The Death-Mother, standing behind the seated subject, annunciates, I watched you sleep, again with only a corresponding caption.  As she utters these words a phallus appears on her body&#45&#45black to match the rest of her.  This briefly equates her mysteriously indifferent empathy with an enacted sexual sameness towards the subject.
            </h3>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>
5)  The stripping of life of the subject.  The genderless doll appears in the hand of the Death Mother and she shaves the subject&#39s head and beard and removes his teeth if possible, leaving him rat-like and impotent and pathetic.  She does this almost modeling his appearance after the doll.
            </h3>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>
6)  Prayer.  The subject performs a prayer, rocking back and forth in his chair towards the mirror.  The Death-Mother grabs his head and makes him shake his body even harder.
            </h3>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>
7)  Behind the subject, reflected in the mirror, the word STAIN sinks onto the back wall, like a stain, though backwards in the reflection.  The STAIN, which is at once what it is, a stain, rather then in time what it is, like the being of the subject, represents the equivalence of speech and act.
            </h3>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>
8)  Close-up of the Death-Mother&#39s lips.  Her lips form the words, Say it like you mean it.  She kicks over the seated subject.
            </h3>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>
9)  He falls, landing in snow that has a whiteness to match the whiteness of the space (this scene will have to be filmed outside in the winter most likely).  His lips chatter&#45&#45this is his truest act of speech in a sense&#45&#45so that the scene parallels all the movements of lips that have come before.
            </h3>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>
10) A caption appears below and each letter dances and spins separately.  The letters read: This Spells Nothing.
            </h3>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>
11)  The final eight bars that explosively conclude the video display a reversal of the opening scene.  The Subject disappears from the snow, the death-mother is re-dressed in a similar piece&#45meal way and all the elements exit the stage one by one in this way.
