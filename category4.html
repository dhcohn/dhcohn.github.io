        <h2>Materialist Tarot: Sample</h2>
        <h1>Materialist Tarot is based on the concept that symbolic representation is not just what we use to understand the world but is in fact the very being  of the world&#151; even pure physicality is nothing without energy.  It  is an art project that shifts the metaphysical themes of a traditional tarot deck into more physical terms while retaining the symbolism.  The archetypes of traditional tarot are not so much translated as re&#45;adorned, given new form while the essence remains the same.   The idea here is that symbols are alive in the world&#151; we do not just indulge in metaphor on occasion but exist in metaphor and speak a language that could only ever be metaphor.  A skeptic of the tarot might ask of it, &#147;how does the tarot claim to divine the future or even represent forces in a person&#146;s life when it is nothing more than an arbitrary system of signs&#63;&#148;  The answer could only be posed by another question:  &#147;how could anyone make calculations about their future or represent their lives to themselves without recourse to inherited arbitrary forms&#63;&#148;  Just as the contingent is part and parcel of the necessary, arbitrary systems of signs are what solidify the world into anything at all.  In some ways what is quantifiable must be qualitative, and so this deck utilizes a numerology of ascending dimensions to break down different types of exeprience.  The four main suits are almost nothing more than basic prepositions while the royal family court uses psychological concepts to  describe basic structures of consciousness.  The trump suit, like in a traditional deck, speaks of a journey that is essentially human, in which questions are asked in different ways to oneself, others, and the world.  The deck therefore may be used several ways&#58; for divination, for introspection, or to simply gain clarity.  You can see a sample of six of the cards below.</h1>

        <h2>Illustrator: Pervert-Schizoid-Woman</h2>
        <h1>
        This is a forthcoming work of philosophy by Professor Williams of the Berklee School of Music.  I will have provided the illustrations over the course of a year.  The collaboration involved regular meetings about the ideas and the images.  It is a deconstructionist work focussing on Freud, Marx, and Saussure that provides a vision of a radical future at the same time that it critiques a western metaphysics of presence established upon the scene of castration.  The philosophy is ultimately constructive of a future in which perversion&#151; conceived as the only possible affirmative attitude towards the contradictions of a psychotically structured society of neurotics&#151; grounds a new orientation of the subject towards the world.</h1>
